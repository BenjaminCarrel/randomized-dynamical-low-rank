# Randomized dynamical low-rank approximation

## Abstract

We introduce new dynamical low-rank (DLR) methods for solving large-scale matrix differential equations, motivated by algorithms from randomized numerical linear algebra.
The new methods consist essentially of two steps: a range estimation step followed by a post-processing step.
For the range estimation, we developed a method that we call dynamical rangefinder.
Then, we propose two ways to perform the post-processing, leading to two time-stepping methods that we respectively call dynamical randomized singular value decomposition (DRSVD) and dynamical generalized Nystr√∂m (DGN).
The cost of the new techniques is comparable to existing DLR techniques.
% Under certain conditions, the two new time-stepping methods are exact on low-rank matrices.
Numerical experiments show that the new methods are robust to stiffness, structure preserving, and are very accurate on various problems.
Interestingly, the new methods do not show any step-size restriction and can therefore be used as one-step solvers.
For each method, a rank-adaptive variant is also proposed.

## Installation instructions

Download or clone the folder with the command
'''
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminCarrel/randomized-dynamical-low-rank.git
cd randomized-dynamical-low-rank
'''

### General

Before running the experiments, you will need to install the following libraries:
- pip
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- jupyter
- tqdm
And add the folders `low_rank_toolbox` and `matrix_ode_toolbox` as source.

### Conda installation

In the terminal, go to the folder and create a new conda environment with the command

`conda env create --file environment.yml`

Then, activate the environment with

`conda activate randomized-dlra`

Finally, compile and install the package with

`pip install --compile .`

### Conda installation with Apple Silicon

Make sure you are using the version of conda that is native for ARM chips.
If unsure, you can install the native version with homebrew by running the command
`brew install miniconda`

Then, create the conda environment with

'''
conda create -n randomized-dlra
conda activate randomized-dlra
'''

Then, install numpy and scipy with Apple's Accelerate BLAS

'''
conda install numpy scipy "libblas=*=*accelerate"
'''

Finally, install other packages and install the compiled version of the package

'''
conda install jupyter tqdm matplotlib pip
pip install --compile .
'''
